## Troubleshooting

### Common Installation Issues

1. **Wrong Python Path**
   - Run `which python3` in terminal to find your Python path
   - Use that full path in the Command field

2. **Wrong Script Path**
   - Make sure to replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual username
   - Verify the file exists: `ls -l ~/goose-personality/src/main.py`
   - Use `echo $HOME` to find your home directory

3. **Repository Issues**
   - If files are missing, clone again:
     ```bash
     cd ~
     rm -rf goose-personality
     git clone https://github.com/Sommer-tidal/goose-personality.git
     ```

4. **Permission Issues**
   - Check file permissions: `ls -l ~/goose-personality/src/main.py`
   - Should show read permissions (r) for your user
