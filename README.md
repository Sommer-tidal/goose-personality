## Troubleshooting

### Common Installation Issues

1. **Wrong Username**
   - Make sure to replace YOURUSERNAME with your actual username
   - Run `echo $USER` in terminal to find your username
   - The path must match where you cloned the repository

2. **File Not Found**
   - Make sure you cloned the repository to your home directory
   - Verify the file exists: `ls -l ~/goose-personality/src/main.py`
   - If the file is missing, clone the repository again

3. **Python Issues**
   - The command path should work on most Macs
   - If it doesn't, try finding your Python path: `which python3`
   - Use that path in the Command field instead

4. **Permission Issues**
   - Check file permissions: `ls -l ~/goose-personality/src/main.py`
   - Should show read permissions (r) for your user
   - Try running: `chmod +r ~/goose-personality/src/main.py`
